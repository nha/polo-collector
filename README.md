# polo-collector

This is a simple collector of tick events of
the [Poloniex](http://poloniex.com/) exchange. It
uses [replikativ](https://replikativ.io) to store and replicate the raw data for
later analysis. Also have a look at
the [twitter-collector](https://github.com/replikativ/twitter-collector), which
can store social media data (e.g. about Bitcoin).

## Usage

Have a look at the `Dockerfile` and `start-app` to see how to run it.
